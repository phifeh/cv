#### Parcify (September 2016 - June 2018)

Parcify was a startup that tried to make it easier for users to have their parcels delivered, and later merged with bringr to become more of a marketplace for couriers.

I was hired as a full stack php (symphony) and javascript (angular) developer, but we later migrated to a node.js microservice architecture.
