I was hired as a full stack php (symfony) and javascript (angular) developer, but we later migrated to a node.js microservice architecture.
Parcify was a start-up that was focused on doing last mile deliveries, which later integrated with Bringr to become a crowd delivery platform. My role as part of a small team was quite diverse, ranging from coming up with new features, to implementing them, both in the backend and the frontend.

- Part of a small team responsible for developing the frontend, backend, devops,..
- everything involved with building and maintaining a microservice architecture.
- Making architectural and technical decisions in a team
- Independently Implemented features such as search with elasticsearch, adyen payments, building a back office tool for the Parcify operations
